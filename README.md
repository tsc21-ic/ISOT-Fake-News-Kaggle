We will be using the ISOT Fake News Dataset [Ahmed et al., 2017],[Ahmed et al., 2018] readily available
from the Kaggle website to perform statistical analysis and predictions. In particular, our dataset analysis is
divided into two parts:

• Part 1: Exploratory analysis of the dataset

• Part 2: Fitting a binary logistic regression (LR) model for prediction of real and fake news

The dataset contains real and fake articles (news) collected from different sources throughout 2016 to 2017.
There are two .csv files, named as “Fake.csv” and “True.csv”. “Fake news” were flagged and collected from
a fact-checking website called Politifact and Wikipedia. “Truthful news” were obtained by scraping from
Reuters news website.
